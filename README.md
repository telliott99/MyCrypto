The files posted here comprise the source to be used by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) to generate pages in html.  

The html is not part of this repository.  If you wish to generate it yourself, you need to install Sphinx

```
pip install sphinx
```

and then do `make html` from within the project directory.

I have more detailed instructions for using Sphinx in another [repo](https://github.com/telliott99/MySphinx).
